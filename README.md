# NeatCartpole
This is my implementation of Neuro Evolution of Augmented topologies (NEAT) in python using the Python neat library (https://neat-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest) solving the 
cartpole environment within Open AI's gym suite of reinforcement learning environments. This was a proof of concept to see how the NEAT algorithm works out in the wild.
